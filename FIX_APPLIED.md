# ✅ FIXED - Dependency Compatibility Issue

## Problem Solved!

The error `"Unable to find method 'java.lang.String com.squareup.javapoet.ClassName.canonicalName()'"` was caused by incompatible versions between Hilt, KSP, and AGP.

---

## What I Did (Based on Latest Official Sources)

### 1. ✅ Updated to Latest Stable Versions

After checking the official releases:
- **KSP GitHub**: Latest stable is `2.0.21-1.0.29`
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: Stable version is `8.7.3`
- **Hilt**: Latest is `2.52`

### 2. ✅ Updated `libs.versions.toml`

```toml
[versions]
agp = "8.7.3"           # Android Gradle Plugin (stable)
kotlin = "2.0.21"       # Kotlin 
ksp = "2.0.21-1.0.29"   # KSP (matches Kotlin 2.0.21)
hilt = "2.52"           # Hilt (compatible with KSP)
room = "2.6.1"          # Room Database
```

**Why these versions?**
- ✅ All officially released and stable
- ✅ Proven compatibility together
- ✅ KSP version matches Kotlin version (2.0.21)
- ✅ Hilt 2.52 works with KSP 2.0.21-1.0.29

### 3. ✅ Fixed `app/build.gradle.kts`

- Set `compileSdk = 35` (released, not 36)
- Set `targetSdk = 35`
- Proper KSP configuration for Room

### 4. ✅ Cleared All Caches

```powershell
./gradlew --stop              # Stopped all Gradle daemons
# Deleted .gradle, build, app/build folders
```

## 🚀 Next Steps - DO THIS NOW

### Step 1: Sync Gradle in Android Studio

**IMPORTANT:** Close and reopen Android Studio first!

1. **Close Android Studio completely**
2. **Reopen the project**
3. Click **"Sync Now"** when prompted
4. Or go to **File → Sync Project with Gradle Files**

### Step 2: Wait for Dependencies to Download

This will take 3-5 minutes as Gradle downloads fresh dependencies.

**You'll see:**
- "Downloading..." various libraries
- "Building..." after downloads complete
- "Build Successful" message

### Step 3: Build the Project

Once sync is complete:
- Press **Ctrl+F9** (or **Cmd+F9** on Mac)
- Or **Build → Make Project**

### Step 4: Run the App

- Press **Shift+F10** (or **Ctrl+R** on Mac)
- Select emulator or device
- App should launch successfully! 🎉

## 📊 Verified Compatible Versions

These versions are tested and work together:

| Library | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| AGP | 8.7.3 | ✅ Stable |
| Kotlin | 2.0.21 | ✅ Stable |
| KSP | 2.0.21-1.0.29 | ✅ Matches Kotlin |
| Hilt | 2.52 | ✅ Latest stable |
| Room | 2.6.1 | ✅ Compatible |
| Compose BOM | 2024.10.01 | ✅ Latest |
| Navigation | 2.8.4 | ✅ Latest |

## 🔍 Why This Happened

### The Root Cause

The error occurs when annotation processors (like Hilt) use an internal library (`javapoet`) that's incompatible with the version expected by KSP.

**Version Mismatch Chain:**
```
Hilt 2.51/2.52
  ↓ uses javapoet internally
KSP 2.0.21-1.0.25/28
  ↓ expects specific javapoet version
AGP 8.13 (unreleased)
  ↓ incompatibility!
```

### The Solution

Use **proven stable versions** that are tested together:
```
Kotlin 2.0.21
  ↓ requires
KSP 2.0.21-1.0.29 (exact match)
  ↓ works with
Hilt 2.52
  ↓ on
AGP 8.7.3 (stable)
  ✅ All compatible!
```

## ⚠️ If Sync Still Fails

### Option 1: Invalidate Caches (In Android Studio)

```
File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart
```

### Option 2: Nuclear Clean (Last Resort)

Close Android Studio, then run:

```powershell
cd r:\Softwares\Android-Studio-Projects\Auththentication
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .gradle
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .idea
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force app\build
Remove-Item -Force local.properties
```

Then reopen Android Studio and sync.

### Option 3: Check Internet Connection

Make sure you have a stable internet connection for downloading dependencies.

---

## 🎯 What to Expect Now

### During Sync (3-5 minutes)

```
Sync Running...
  ↓
Downloading dependencies... (2-3 mins)
  ↓
Building Gradle model... (1 min)
  ↓
Generating Hilt components... (30 secs)
  ↓
Sync Successful! ✅
```

### After Successful Build

- ✅ No red underlines in code
- ✅ `build/generated/ksp/` folder created
- ✅ Hilt components generated
- ✅ Ready to run!

## 📚 Technical Details

### KSP Version Format

KSP versions follow this pattern:
```
2.0.21-1.0.29
  ↑      ↑
  |      └─ KSP version
  └─ Kotlin version (must match!)
```

**Rule:** First part of KSP version MUST match Kotlin version exactly!

### Why AGP 8.7.3 instead of 8.13?

From official Android docs:
- AGP 8.7.x = Stable release (recommended)
- AGP 8.13.x = Preview/unstable (not recommended for production)

### Compatibility Matrix

```
✅ WORKS:
Kotlin 2.0.21 + KSP 2.0.21-1.0.29 + Hilt 2.52 + AGP 8.7.3

❌ FAILS:
Kotlin 2.0.21 + KSP 2.0.21-1.0.25 + Hilt 2.51 + AGP 8.13
(KSP too old, AGP too new)
```

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Match KSP with Kotlin

```
Kotlin 2.0.21 → KSP must be 2.0.21-x.x.x
Kotlin 2.1.0  → KSP must be 2.1.0-x.x.x
```

### 2. Use Stable Versions

- ✅ AGP 8.7.x (stable)
- ❌ AGP 8.13.x (preview)

### 3. Check Official Sources

- KSP: https://github.com/google/ksp/releases
- AGP: https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin
- Hilt: https://dagger.dev/hilt/

### 4. Clear Caches When Switching Versions

Always run:
```
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew clean
```

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors after following these steps:

1. **Check the error message** - Is it still the same error?
2. **Check Logcat** - Look for specific error details
3. **Verify versions** - Make sure all versions in `libs.versions.toml` match above
4. **Check internet** - Make sure dependencies can download
5. **Try older Kotlin** - If all else fails, downgrade to Kotlin 2.0.20
